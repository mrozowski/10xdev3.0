# 10x Games: Copilot Instructions

## Product and architecture

- This is an Astro 7 static site for a retro browser-game collection, deployed to GitHub Pages. `src/pages/` supplies file-based routes, `src/layouts/` owns the shared document shell, and `src/components/` contains page-level UI. The current `index.astro` and `Welcome.astro` are unmodified Astro starter content and should be replaced as the game site is implemented.
- The MVP is the landing-page game catalogue plus one complete Memory Cards game. Keep each game isolated so future games can be added without restructuring the existing game.
- Keep game interaction in client-side Astro islands. Game state, optional player names, and high scores are device-local (browser storage); the MVP has no backend, database, accounts, cloud synchronization, ads, analytics, or player-data collection.
- Themes determine the Memory Cards images. Add supplied visual and audio assets without coupling asset changes to game logic. The game must support phones, tablets, and desktop devices while keeping the initial page load lightweight.
- Treat `context/foundation/prd.md` as the product source of truth. It defines the gameplay, score, privacy, performance, and MVP scope requirements. `context/foundation/tech-stack.md` records the Astro and GitHub Pages deployment choice.

## Commands

Use Node.js `>=22.12.0` and npm.

| Purpose | Command |
| --- | --- |
| Install dependencies | `npm install` |
| Run the development server | `npm run dev` |
| Production build | `npm run build` |
| Preview a production build | `npm run preview` |
| Run Astro CLI checks or commands | `npm run astro -- check` |

No test runner, single-test command, linter, or lint script is configured yet.

## Repository conventions

- Preserve Astro's static-output model. Configure `site` and any required `base` path in `astro.config.mjs` as part of GitHub Pages deployment work.
- Foundation documents under `context/foundation/` are living documents: update them in place when product decisions change. Change-scoped planning belongs in `context/changes/<change-id>/`; do not modify `context/archive/`, which is immutable by convention.
- The current `.github/copilot-instructions.md` also retains the repository's installed 10x workflow guidance below. Follow its scoped-document and archived-change rules when invoking its skills.

## 10xDevs AI Toolkit - Module 2, Lesson 1

Move from sprint-zero setup to project orchestration with the **roadmap chain**:

```
(Module 1 foundation docs) -> /10x-roadmap -> backlog-ready roadmap items
```

`/10x-roadmap` is the lesson focus. `/10x-new` is intentionally introduced in Module 2, Lesson 2, when a selected roadmap item becomes an implementation change folder.

### Task Router - Where to start

| Skill | Use it when |
| --- | --- |
| **Roadmap (lesson focus)** | |
| `/10x-roadmap` | You have `context/foundation/prd.md` and a scaffolded project baseline, and you need a vertical-first MVP roadmap. The skill reads the PRD, inspects the code baseline, uses available foundation docs such as `tech-stack.md`, `infrastructure.md`, and `deploy-plan.md`, then writes `context/foundation/roadmap.md`. Use it BEFORE creating per-change folders or implementation plans. |
| **Re-run upstream if needed** | |
| `/10x-shape` / `/10x-prd` / `/10x-tech-stack-selector` / `/10x-bootstrapper` / `/10x-agents-md` / `/10x-infra-research` | Bundled from Module 1 so foundation contracts can be fixed before roadmap sequencing. If roadmap generation exposes a PRD gap, repair the PRD before pretending the backlog is ready. |

### How the chain hands off

- `/10x-roadmap` bridges product and implementation. It does not choose frameworks, design schemas, or write a per-change implementation plan.
- The output is `context/foundation/roadmap.md`: ordered milestones, vertical slices, bounded foundations, dependencies, unknowns, risk, and backlog handoff fields.
- Roadmap items should receive stable human-readable identifiers in backlog tools. The actual `context/changes/<change-id>/` folder is created in Lesson 2 with `/10x-new`.

### Roadmap boundaries

- Default to vertical slices: user-visible outcomes that cross UI, data, business logic, and integrations.
- Horizontal work is allowed only as a bounded enabler that names the downstream vertical milestone it unlocks.
- Avoid orphan horizontal work such as "build the whole database", "build all API endpoints", or "design the whole UI" before the first user-visible flow.
- Roadmap is not a calendar estimate. Do not invent dates, story points, or sprint velocity unless the user explicitly asks for a separate planning artifact.

### Foundation paths used by this lesson

- `context/foundation/prd.md` - input
- `context/foundation/tech-stack.md` - optional input
- `context/foundation/infrastructure.md` - optional input
- `context/deployment/deploy-plan.md` - optional input
- `context/foundation/roadmap.md` - output
- `context/foundation/lessons.md` - recurring rules and pitfalls
- `docs/reference/contract-surfaces.md` - load-bearing names registry

Skills must not write to `context/archive/`. Archived changes are immutable; if a resolved target path starts with `context/archive/`, abort with: "This change is archived. Open a new change with `/10x-new` instead."
